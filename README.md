# LAMP stack built with Docker Compose

This repository provides a basic LAMP stack environment built using Docker Compose. It consists of the following:

- Linux Base (Debian Buster)
- Apache (v2.4)
- PHP (v8.2)
- MySQL (via MariaDB v10.6)

It also come with phpMyAdmin preinstalled to help you manage your databases.

## Setup Docker
If you are on Windows, it is recommended to install Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2) to improve performance:
- Type `Powershell` in the Windows search bar then right-click and select `Run as administrator`
- In the Powershell window, run these commands:
  - `wsl --install`
  - `wsl --set-default-version 2`

This will install and configure WSL2 and a basic Ubuntu image.

On all systems, you need to have the basic Docker containerization tool installed:
- Download and install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- You do NOT need to create a docker account to download docker desktop or to use this project.

## Installation
To use this LAMP container, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository on your local computer (or just download a zip archive)
- Rename cs404.env to .env (this file contains environment variables for docker-compose)
- Run `docker-compose up -d` from the root of the project
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

You can edit the files in `www` to see changes reflected in the browser. PHP 8.2 is supported.

## Setup Docker to use WSL (Windows only)
You must tell docker to use WSL in its settings:
- Start Docker Desktop and Navigate to Settings
- From the General tab, check the box next to `Use WSL 2 based engine` (if it is not already checked)
- Select `Apply & Restart`

## Credit
This is a copy of the sprintcube docker-compose-lamp repo, with some modifications to suit the needs of our class. Extra PHP and MySQL versions have been removed along with redis, and the project structure has been simplified.
